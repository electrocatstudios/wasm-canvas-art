# wasm-canvas-art
Rust WASM based canvas art projects

## Overview 
A collection of little WASM apps using Canvas. I hope to do You Tube videos on these in the near future but for now the code is provided as-is.

### Running the code
Make sure you have `trunk` installed on the CLI. (https://trunkrs.dev/)[https://trunkrs.dev/]

Then cd to the desired example and run `trunk serve`, it should build everything and allow you access through a browser.
